Menus are used to browse around web pages. Due to their important role to operate web pages and applications, they need to be usable in all circumstances.

* **[Structure](menus-structure.html):** Mark up menus in a way that reflects the structure of its content and makes identification possible.

* **[Styling](menus-styling.html):** Use commonly recognized design patterns to identify menus and indicate the state of menu items.

* **[Fly-out Menus](menus-flyout.html):** Implement fly-out menus to organize menus with branching sub-items.

* **[Web Application Menus](application-menus.html):** Use special markup and scripting to define a menu for a web application that works like application menus in desktop operating systems.

## Why is this important?

Menus reflect the underlying structure of websites, individual web pages, and multi-step processes such as check-out forms.They allow users to get an overview on the content and access information and functionality more easily when implemented properly.

* **Screen reader and keyboard users** benefit from keyboard interoperability and markup that allows them to operate menus in different ways.

* **Users with fine motor difficulties and touch screen users** have larger targets to click or tap on. In fly-out menus, submenus do not disappear immediately after the mouse has left the clickable area.

* **People with limited attention or short term memory** benefit from being able to easily discover the current page in the menu.
