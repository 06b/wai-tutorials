Menus are used to browse around web pages (“navigation menus”) or initiate actions inside web applications (“application menus”). They are often implemented in the form of fly-out menus. Due to their important role to operate web pages and web applications, they need to be usable in all circumstances. This tutorial covers the following topics:

* **[Structure](structure.html):** Mark up menus to reflect their structure and to identify them.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use commonly recognized design patterns and indicate the current menu item.

* **[Fly-out Menus](flyout.html):** Use fly-out menus to organize menus with branching sub-items.

* **[Web Application Menus](application.html):** Use markup to define the functionality of menu items.

## Why is this important?

Navigation menus reflect the underlying structure of websites, individual web pages, and multi-step processes such as check-out forms. Applications menus reflect the available functionality. Both types of menus allow users to get an overview on the content and access information and functionality more easily, when menus are implemented properly.

* **Screen reader and keyboard users** benefit from keyboard interoperability and markup that allows users to operate the menus in different ways.

* **Users with fine motor difficulties and touch screen users** have larger targets to click or tap on, and fly-out menus do not disappear immediately after the mouse has left the submenu.

* **People with attention and short term memory limitations** benefit from being able to discover where the current focus is located.
