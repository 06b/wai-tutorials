Menus are used for navigation and to provide functionality, and critical parts of web pages.

* **[Structure](structure.html):** Mark up menus in a way that reflects their structure and that identifies them as such.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use commonly recognized design patterns to distinguish menus and the state of menu items.

* **[Fly-out Menus](flyout.html):** Ensure fly-out (drop-down) sub-menus can be used appropriately by mouse and keyboard.

* **[Application Menus](application-menus.html):** Add markup and keyboard behavior to resemble desktop application menus.

## Why is this important?

Navigation menus reflect the underlying structure of websites, individual web pages, and multi-step processes, such as a check-out form. Application menus provide key functionality of the application. Thus menus are critical parts of web pages and require particular attention during design and development.

* **Screen reader and keyboard users** benefit from keyboard interoperability and markup that allows them to operate menus in different ways.

* **Users with fine motor difficulties and touch screen users** have larger targets to click or tap on. In fly-out menus, sub-menus do not disappear immediately after the mouse has left the clickable area.

* **People with limited attention or short term memory** benefit from clear and distinct menus with easily identifiable states, such as the current page.
