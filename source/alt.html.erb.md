Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. They are designed to help you incorporate accessibility best practices into your workflow, one step at a time. They will help you to apply [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) in the every day work you do and provide practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). 

But the tutorials are not just for the **HTML, CSS and JavaScript aficionados** among us, they will also help 

* **designers** to create web components that are the base for accessible implementation, 
* **trainers** to create better course materials more efficiently, 
* **content authors** to understand the background of the work they doing, 
* and **project managers** to integrate accessibility thinking into project planning.

The tutorials cover various accessibility topics, including some advanced concepts. They are a starting point to learn about and understand WCAG by showing examples of accessible web components. While those examples cannot be exhaustive, the concepts apply to other situations as well. To make sure that WCAG is met, referring to WCAG resources directly may be needed. The growing tutorial library starts with [images](images/index.html) and [tables](images/index.html) tutorials.

We use HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA and other advanced web technologies in these examples, but the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.

Authoring tools (like Content Management Systems, <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, …) used to produce content should be able to create documents that meet WCAG requirements. The requirements for these tools are defined in the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag). It’s important that you further investigate the accessibility features of the authoring tools used in your environment as you use these tutorials. Be sure that you understand the capability of your tools to produce accessible content and take care to implement and maintain accessibility with the tools at hand.
