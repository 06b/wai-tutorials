## Overview

Using a scenario where accessible HTML radio buttons need to be replaced with a custom radio group,
this tutorial demonstrates three fundamental concepts all developers must understand before using ARIA. 
To help ensure developers can effectively and safely apply ARIA, it teaches:

1. Purpose: What ARIA does, i.e., understanding the role of ARIA gives developers amazing powers.
2. Limits: What ARIA does not do, i.e., using those amazing powers comes with critical responsibilities to provide the accessibility that ARIA does not provide.
3. Risks: Why appropriate use is critical to avoiding negative impacts on accessibility, i.e., why no ARIA is better than bad ARIA.

## Objective

Developers gain understanding of ARIA concepts sufficient to:

* Safely and creatively exploit the power of ARIA to build rrich experiences that are fully accessible.
* Effectively utilize the patterns, examples, guidance,  and techniques available in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices.
