### What ARIA is and does

ARIA is the developer telling the browser what to tell the assistive technology about what the developer has done;

* in order that a screen reader user can reliably know what feature is present, and to be able to operate it (perceive what it is, understand what it means, and operate on it)
* if you use any role, the developer is telling the AT via browser that they have provided keyboard support.
