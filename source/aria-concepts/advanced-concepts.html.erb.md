ARIA is more than just another way to do things that you can already do in HTML

* it's a canvas with which you can build anything
* you can use it to build things with advanced functionality such as...
* consider examples such as:
  * tree example & discussion
  * slider example & discussion
* but the core concepts are still important, such as keyboard, role, and states and properties
* let the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide do the rest
