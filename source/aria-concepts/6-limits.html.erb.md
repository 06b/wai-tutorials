## What ARIA isn’t, and doesn’t do

* ARIA does not create any semantics;
* ARIA does not change what the browser does;
* ARIA doesn't add any functionality;
* ARIA is not a cross-platform API for interoperability.
* When you uses ARIA, you acquire new responsibilities


ARIA is another way to make things accessible, but it comes with responsibilities.

Talk about what aria does not solve.

Doing so will require more than just ARIA; it will require JavaScript as well.

To make it functional, give it keyboard support (for operability)

At this point, the ARIA is telling a lie! It this div is a checkbox, but it really is not because it does not yet behave like a checkbox.

ARIA does not change browser behavior. Adding the role only tells ....
