## Essential Take-Aways

1. Use semantic HTML when practical; it provides very robust accessibility.
2. ARIA tells browsers how to describe widgets and structures to assistive technologies.
3. Browsers do not provide keyboard interfaces because of ARIA attributes. 
4. For custom widgets, Authors are expected to provide keyboard interfaces that are consistent with the expectations for the widget role as described in the [ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex).
5. Use ARIA cautiously. Do not make assumptions about the meaning of an ARIA role, state, or property based on its name. Read the authoring practices or specification and test, test, test.

## Unleash Creativity

With ARIA, nearly any imaginable user GUI can be made very assistive technology friendly. 
To harness that power, it is first necessary to understand the purpose and effects of ARIA's roles, states, and properties.
The [Authoring Practices design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex) and their supporting guidance provide vetted reference implementations that demonstrate the intended use and ramifications of ARIA attributes.
