## What ARIA Does and Does Not Do

1. ARIA tells browsers what to tell assistive technologies about the meaning, purpose, and behaviors of elements. 
2. ARIA does not create or change appearance or behaviors. 

Similar to how visual design expresses meaning through color, style, and position, ARIA expresses meaning with roles, states, and properties. 
Unlike visual design where there are infinite ways of expressing a specific affordance, each ARIA role, state, and property conveys a specific meaning. 
So, armed with an understanding of the definitions and conventions associated with each ARIA role, state, and property, developers can accurately express the meanings and behaviors of nearly any visual design they can dream.
