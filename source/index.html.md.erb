In these pages you'll find practical guidance and working examples of accessible web page components and interactive widgets. Each tutorial is a multi-page resource illustrating or explaining how to make sure your website is accessible.

The tutorials provide guidance on how to develop web content that meets WCAG 2.0, providing working samples of some of the WCAG2.0 Sufficient Techniques. However, neither these tutorials nor the Sufficient Techniques are the only ways to meet WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria, which are the sole measure of web accessibility.

If you are a project manager, a Web developer, a Web trainer, or are otherwise involved in website authoring, you will find the information you need to help you produce an accessible website in these pages. They provide focused tutorials with examples of best practice and explanatory resources to inform the creation or selection of accessible web applications . Examples are provided in HTML, which is used to discuss the different techniques in a concrete way, however the principles should be applied to all formats used to present information over the Web.

The tutorials are not exhaustive, : the range and diversity of web content and applications used in websites make it impossible to cover all situations. To counteract this, some tutorials will deal with overarching principles, such as keyboard control, while others are on specific types of content, such as images.

Suggestions or comments on and contributions to the development of these tutorials are welcomed. In the first instance, please write to us by email to [wai-eo-editors@w3.org](mailto:wai-eo-editors@w3.org).
