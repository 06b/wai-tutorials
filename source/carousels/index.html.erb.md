Accessible carousels have robust structure and provide user control:

- **[Structure](structure.html):** Provide structure markup for the carousel body and its items.

- **[Functionality](functionality.html):** Add functionality to display and announce carousel items.

- **[Animations](animations.html):** Add animation and ensure users have control over these animations.

## What are carousels?

Carousels, also known as "slide shows" and "sliders", show a collection of items one at a time. For example, scrolling news headlines and featured articles on homepages are common uses of carousels.

## What are the key points?

- Users must be able to pause carousel movement because it can be too fast to read or distracting.

- All functionality, including navigating between carousel items, needs to be usable by keyboard.

- Carousel item changes must be announced to users, and may not interfere with the current focus.

## Why is this important?

Carousels are typically prominently located and provide important functionality. Accessible carousels are essential for many website users including:

- **People using keyboard navigation and voice input software** can navigate between carousel items.
- **People using screen readers** will understand where they are and how to navigate between carousel items.
- **People who are distracted by movement** are able to pause the animations while reading the web page.
- **People who need more time to read** have sufficient time to read and understand each carousel item.
