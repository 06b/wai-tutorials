Carousels, commonly also referred to as “slide shows” or “sliders”, display a series of content items one at a time; for example, a series of news headlines. Carousels are usually animated, so that the displayed item is periodically rotated. This tutorial highlights the particular accessibility considerations for such carousels:

- **[Structure](structure.html):** Provide structural markup for the carousel and its items, and later enhance these structures with styling and scripting.

- **[Functionality](controls.html):** Provide functionality to display the carousel items one at a time, and to allow users to browse through them.

- **[Animations](animations.html):** Provide users with control over any animations in your carousel.

## Why is this important?

Carousels are frequently used, in particular on home pages, to draw the readers' attention to featured articles and products of the website. Given their prominence, inaccessible carousels can be a major obstacle for many website visitors. On the other hand, accessible carousels provide more effective access for many users including:

- **People using keyboard navigation and voice input software** can navigate between carousel items.
- **People using screen readers** will understand where they are and how to navigate between carousel items.
- **People who are distracted by movement** are able to pause the animations while reading the web page.
- **People who need more time to read** have sufficient time to read and understand each carousel item.
