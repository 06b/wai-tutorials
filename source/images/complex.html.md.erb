title: Complex Images
status: draft
order: 6
---

Complex images are those that contain substantial information, more than
can be conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. These are typically:

-   Graphs and charts, including flow charts and organizational charts;
-   Diagrams and illustrations where the page text relies on the user
    being able to understand the image;
-   Maps showing locations or other information such as weather systems.

In these situations a two-part text alternative is required, first the
short description to identify the image and, where appropriate, indicate
the location of the second part, which is a long description of the
image. The long description must be a textual representation of the
essential information conveyed by the image. In certain situations the
composition of the image may also be needed as part of the long
description, but only where it is important that the user understands
the image construction. This page shows several possible approaches that
can be used to provide both short and long descriptions.

## Example 1: Image containing substantial information {#ex1}

This bar chart of website visitor statistics has the short description "
Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2013
for sites 1 to 3" as the *alt* attribute, identifying the image. The
long description details the information, including scales, values,
relationships and trends, that are represented visually. For example,
the declining values for site 1, consistent values for site 2, and
increasing values for site 3 are highlighted through the bar chart
representation. This information needs to be made available in the [long
text description](2013first_qtr_text)as well.

**2013 first quarter example.com website visitors**

![Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter
2013 for sites 1 to 3](../img/chart2.jpg)

### Approach 1: Providing a link to the long description via *longdesc* {#ap1}

Here the *longdesc* attribute contains the URI of the page containing
the long description. Where appropriate, the *longdesc* value could
simply contain a hash link to the long description if it is published on
the same page as the image.

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<p>
	<img
		src="chart.png"
		alt="Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2013 for sites 1 to 3"
		longdesc="2013first_qtr_text.html">
</p>
~~~

<%= code_end %>

**Note:** Both Firefox and Chrome browsers are working on
implementations that will make the *longdesc linked* long description
location reachable by all users. In older or other browsers it is only
available to screen reader users.

### Approach 2: A text link to the long description adjacent to the image {#ap2}

This approach provides a text link next to the image. The link text
makes both the destination and the association with the image clear.

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<p>
	<img
		src="chart.png"
		alt="Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2013 for sites 1 to 3">
	<br>
	<a href="2013first_qtr_text.html">Example.com Site visitors Jan to March 2013 text description of the bar chart</a>
</p>
~~~

<%= code_end %>

<%= notes_start %>

**Note:** This approach is well supported in all browsers and ensures
that everyone has access to the data as well as the image, no matter
what browser or assistive technologies they may use.

<%= notes_end %>

### Approach 3: Describing the location of the long description in the *alt* attribute {#ap3}

If the long description is on the same page as the image and its
location can be accurately pinpointed by being described, the
*alt* attribute can include location information.

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<p>
	<img
		src="chart.png"
		alt="Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2013 for sites 1 to 3. Described under the heading Site visitors full text.">
</p>
<h4>Site visitors full text</h4>
~~~

<%= code_end %>

### Approach 4: Structurally associating the image and its adjacent long description (HTML5) {#ap4}

The HTML5 `<figure>` element can be used to enclose both the image and
its long description. The long description, presented as headings, text
and a table, is explicitly associated to the image by using
`role="group"` on the containing `<figure>` element.

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<figure role="group">
	<img src="chart.png"
		alt="Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2013 for sites 1 to 3, described in full below.">
	<h2>Trends</h2>
	<p>Site visitors for the first  ...</p>
	<h2>Statistics</h2>
	<table>
		<caption>Example.com Site visitors Jan to March 2013</caption>
		<tr>â€¦</tr>
	</table>
</figure>
~~~

<%= code_end %>
