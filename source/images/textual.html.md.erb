title: Images of Text
status: draft
order: 5

Images of text are those that display text that is intended to be read.
The strongest design technique is to use actual text – styled with CSS –
rather than image-based text presentation. This is because actual text
is flexible, it can be resized without losing clarity and the background
and text colors can be modified to suit users’ reading preferences.
Images are more likely to distort and pixelate when resized. In those
uncommon situations where images of text must be used, the text
alternative must contain the same text presented in the image.

## Image of styled text with decorative effect
{:.ex}

This slogan image contains text with decorative effects that cannot be
realized with CSS styling. The text alternative is the same as that
presented in the image: “Your access to the city”. The decorative
effects (stylized text and green line) should not be described.

<%= sample_start %>

![City Lights: your access to the city.](bad-top-text.png)

<%= sample_end %>

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<img src="access-city.png" alt="Your access to the city.">
~~~

<%= code_end %>

<%= notes_start %>

**Note:** The visual effects in the above image could have been produced
using CSS3 and an embedded font. However some authors and developers may
need to support older browsers and may find this example useful.

<%= notes_end %>

## Image of text used as an unlinked logo
{:.ex}

The following image is the logo for the Web Accessibility Initiative. It is not part of a link so the text alternative is “Web Accessibility Initiative”. There is no need to mention that it is a logo:

<%= sample_start %>

![Web Accessibility initiative](wai.png)

<%= sample_end %>

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<img src="wai.png" alt="Web Accessibility initiative">
~~~

<%= code_end %>

<%= notes_start %>

**Note 1:** Images used as logos are exempt from some of the accessibility guidance that applies to other images of text, for instance there are no minimum color contrast and text size requirements.

**Note 2:** If this logo were linked then it would become a functional image; See [Functional Images &rarr; Image used alone as a linked logo](../functional/#image-used-alone-as-a-linked-logo).

<%= notes_end %>

## Image of a mathematical expression
{:.ex}

This math expression shows how to signify that a number is recurring.
The `alt` text is “0.3333 recurring, (the recurrence is indicated by a
line over the ‘3’ in the fourth decimal place)”. In this instance the
way that the recurrence is shown is important, so forms part of the text
alternative, this isn't the case with all math expressions.

<%= sample_start %>

![0.3333 recurring, (the recurrence is indicated by a line over the '3'
in the fourth decimal place)](repeat1.png)

<%= sample_end %>

<%= notes_start %>

**Note:** Images of math expressions should only be used in exceptional circumstances, for instance where the expression is an exception to the normal content for the page or website. In use cases where math forms a substantial part of page or website content, [Math ML](http://www.w3.org/Math/) should be used instead as it represents both presentation and content semantically, making it more accessible to a wider range of users as many assistive technologies can interpret the code. The simple example above illustrates the difficulty of describing both the content and presentation (the position and location of the over-line) in mathematical expressions succinctly and clearly, for more complex expressions or equations image text alternatives are unlikely to provide sufficient detail succinctly.

### Code snippet for image

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<img
	src="0dot3333recurring.png"
	alt="0.3333 recurring, (the recurrence is indicated by a line over the ‘3’ in the fourth decimal place)">
~~~

<%= code_end %>

### Code snippet for Math ML

Math ML can be incorporated into both XHTML and HTML5: @@@Seems not to work in any browsers@@@
{:.todo}

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<mstack stackalign="right">
	<msline length="1"/>
	<mn> 0.3333 </mn>
</mstack>
~~~

<%= code_end %>

<%= notes_start %>

**Note:** The above code includes semantic information that conveys both
content and presentation to assistive technologies.

<%= notes_end %>
