Page structure is a useful way for all users to quickly understand how content is related. For users of assistive technology, well structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications.

* **[Page Regions](regions.html):** Identify and mark up regions on web pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles.

* **[Labeling Regions](labels.html):** Name regions to allow users to distinguish and access them.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add headings and nest them logically to label sections of web pages according to their relationships and importance.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses appropriate and meaningful elements.

## Why is this important?

Well structured pages are essential for many web users, including:

* **People with cognitive and learning disabilities** will be able to easier prioritize and find content on the page.
* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** will be more efficient when they are able to navigate the page bypassing some sections. If this is not possible, users need to use multiple strokes of the tab key to navigate through the links in a specific section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **People with visual impairments**, including people with low vision, have cues that provide orientation on the page and in the content.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to better index content of a web page.
