This tutorial shows how to use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation through a web page and application. Proper page structure makes it easier to everyone to understand the content. It also facilitates the effectiveness of assistive technology and other alternative devices when they are used to use the web.

* **[Page Sections](sections.html):** Identify and mark section on pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles. This ensures the purpose of each individual section is conveyed to users.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add logically nested headings of different levels to create sections of content.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses the best available element for the content. This allows users to style the content in a way they like and also allows assistive technology to differentiate between types of content.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Consistent styling allows users to keep track of their position in the web page and of what is important on the page.

* **[In-page Navigation](in-page-navigation.html):** Provide navigation aids that allow users to get to specific sections of a web page more easily. Consider using a “table of content” for longer pieces of content.

## Why is this important?

A good page structure makes prioritizing and identifying content easier for everyone, in particular for those with congnitive and learning disabilities. The visual structure serves as cues that are used by people with visual impairments, including people with low vision, to orient themselves on the page and in the content.

* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** will be more efficient when they are able to navigate the page bypassing some sections. If this is not possible, users need to use multiple strokes of the tab key to navigate through the links in a specific section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader or reading mode” that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* **Search engines** are able to distinguish between main content and other sections of the page. They could also identify the navigation and show links to sub pages directly on the search results page.
