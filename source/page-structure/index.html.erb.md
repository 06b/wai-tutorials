This tutorial shows how to use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation through a web page and application. Proper page structure facilitates the effectiveness of assistive technology and other alternative devices that use the web.

* **[Page Sections](sections.html):** Identify and mark section on pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles. This ensures the purpose of each individual section is conveyed to users.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add logically nested headings of different levels to create sections of content. This helps to convey page structure.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses the best available element for the content. This allows users to style the content in a way they like and also allows assistive technology to differentiate between types of content.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Consistent styling allows users to keep track of their position in the web page and of what is important on the page.

* **[In-page Navigation](in-page-navigation.html):** Provide navigation aids that allow users to get to specific sections of a web page more easily. Consider using a “table of content” for longer pieces of content.

## Why is this important?

An accessible page structure benefits users in many situations:

* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** will be more efficient when they are able to navigate the page bypassing some sections. If this is not possible, users need to use multiple strokes of the tab key to navigate through the links in a specific section.
* **People with cognitive disabilities** can use software that only shows the main content of the web page. If the page structure is correctly marked up, they will receive better results.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
