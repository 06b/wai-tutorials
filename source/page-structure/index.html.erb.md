Proper page structure makes it easier for everyone to understand the content. It also facilitates the effectiveness of users that use assistive technology or other alternative devices. This tutorial shows how to use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and applications. 

* **[Page Regions](regions.html):** Identify and mark up regions on web pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add logically nested headings of different levels to label sections of content.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page in a way that uses the best available element.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use consistent styling to allow users to keep track of their position in the web page and of what is important on the page.

* **[In-page Navigation](in-page-navigation.html):** Provide mechanisms to navigate between sections of a web page. Consider using a “table of contents” for longer pieces of content.

## Why is this important?

A good page structure makes prioritizing and identifying content easier for everyone, in particular for those with congnitive and learning disabilities. The visual structure serves as cues that are used by people with visual impairments, including people with low vision, to orient themselves on the page and in the content.

* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** will be more efficient when they are able to navigate the page bypassing some sections. If this is not possible, users need to use multiple strokes of the tab key to navigate through the links in a specific section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* **Search engines** are able to distinguish between main content and other sections of the page. They could also identify the navigation and show links to sub pages directly on the search results page.
