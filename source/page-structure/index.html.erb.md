Web pages should be structured in such a way that helps people using assistive technology to engage the content efficiently. This tutorial shows how to use HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to help orientation on web pages.

* **[Page Sections](sections.html):** Identify and mark section on pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA roles. This ensures the purpose of each individual section is conveyed to users.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Add headings of different levels to create sections of content. This helps to convey page structure.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up the content on a page to adapt to a user’s needs. This will help interpret the content as well.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use a distinct hierarchy to the visual design of a page. Users will be able to determine what each page section does more easily.

* **[In-page Navigation](in-page-navigation.html):** Use navigation aids to help users to get around the page. These help discover the various sections of a page. Consider using a “table of content” for longer pieces of content.

## Why is this important?

The content of the page is why people visit websites in the first place. Major barriers occur when users are unable to find content or navigate inside individual pages. An accessible page structure has many benefits. These include:

* **Search engines** can use the data to make better predictions on the real content of a web page.
* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them. Content is read out in the way it is intended.
* **People who use distraction-free reading plugins** will receive better results when the main content is easy to determine.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* **Keyboard users** can save the time and trouble to navigate through a number of links using the tab key.
