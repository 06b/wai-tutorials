Captions make online video and audio clips accessible to people who are
deaf or hard of hearing. Audio descriptions make online media accessible
to people who are blind or visually impaired. This tutorial will
demonstrate how to add captions and audio descriptions to media
distributed online, for playback on desktop or mobile devices. Other
accessibility techniques, such as transcripts and foreign-language
subtitles, will also be included in the discussion.

Common methods for making media accessible.
-------------------------------------------

-   **Audio descriptions**: An extra track of narration that conveys
    information about important on-screen elements, such as body
    language, changes in scenery and context, on-screen charts and
    diagrams, etc.
-   **Captions**: A text version of the program dialogue and narration,
    or other spoken words, fully synchronized with the program audio and
    displayed within the media player. Captions also include text
    identifying non-speech information, such as music and sound effects.
-   **Subtitles**: A text version of a program's audio track, fully
    synchronized with the audio and translated into another language.
-   **Transcript**: A text version of a program's audio track,
    containing narration or dialog plus non-speech information such as
    speaker-identification cues. Transcripts can be static documents or
    they can be interactive: e.g., a transcript can be synchronized so
    that words are highlighted automatically as they are spoken, or
    words can selected by the user in order to move to that spot in the
    video.

Quality considerations {#quality}
----------------------

The quality of the captions and descriptions that are delivered to users
is of high importance. In the same way that low-quality, incomplete
audio is unacceptable to hearing viewers, captions that do not
accurately reflect the audio, or contain spelling and grammatical
errors, are unacceptable to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. Similarly,
audio descriptions that provide misleading or inaccurate information, or
which provide unnecessary detail (e.g., by giving away clues or
answers), are of no use to viewers who are blind or visually impaired.

Why is this important?
----------------------

Without captions, users who are deaf or hard of hearing will not be able
to understand the audio portion of a media presentation. And without
audio descriptions, users who are blind or visually impaired will not
know about important visual elements during a video presentation. But
captions and descriptions have benefits beyond their original target
audiences:

-   Captions are useful when teaching children and adults how to read,
    or to help people learn a foreign language.
-   Captions can be used by all people: for example, in noisy
    environments such as a bar or an airport lounge, or in any place
    where it would be inappropriate to turn up the volume.
-   Search engines can use captions as a way to locate information in a
    video or audio presentation.
-   Audio descriptions can be used to reinforce complex visual concepts,
    especially for children or adults with learning disabilities.

descriptions are necessary, see the [caption/description decision
tree](g).
