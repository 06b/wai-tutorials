Navigation Menus are used to browse around websites. Usually they consist of a list, or nested lists, of links. As they are so vital to access content on websites, they need to be operable with pointing devices (like a mouse) and keyboards.

A good navigation is not only the task of programmers and authors. The overall content organization of the website should lead to a coherent and comprehensible page structure. A navigation that represents such a page structure will help all users to navigate the website. Designers should ensure that contrast ratios are sufficient for all users and fonts are big enough.

This tutorial includes the following pages:

* **[Structure](structure.html):** Mark up navigations to enable easy access to all pages of the website.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Use different types of navigation in different situations and mark the current page in the navigation.

* **[Fly-out Menus](dropdowns.html):** When working with large menus with different navigation levels, fly-outs can be used to enable users to quickly access pages in lower hierarchies.

* **[Multiple Ways](multiple-ways.html)**: Many users benefit from alternative ways to traverse through the content of a website, for example by using sitemaps or breadcrumb trails.

## Why is this important?

* **All users** use the navigation to reach different sections of the website, it is usually the central way of exploring and point of reference if the user gets lost.
* **Screen reader** and **keyboard users** should be aware which link is currently in focus and about the currently selected item.
* **Mouse** and **touch screen users**, as well as **users with shaky hands** need large targets to tap on.
