Navigations are used to navigate around the website and around individual web pages. Usually they consist of a list of links and need to be operable with pointing devices (like a mouse) and keyboards.

A good navigation on a website is not only the programmerâ€™s task. It begins with the overall content organization of the website, which should lead to a coherent and comprehensible page structure of the website, which is the base for the navigation. Additionally, the design of a navigation is very important to ensure the [contrast ratio](/fundamentals/color.html) is sufficient for all users and fonts are big enough.

This tutorial shows you how to use markup, styling and interaction to website navigation. It includes the following pages:

* **[Navigation Types](types.html):** An introduction into the basic HTML structure for horizontal, vertical, and breadcrumb navigations.
* **[Skip Links and In-page Navigation](in-page.html):** Use (hidden) links to jump to different parts of a web page when using the keyboard.
* **[Dropdowns](dropdowns.html):** Implement a dropdown menu in an accessible way.

## Why is this important?

* **All users** use the navigation to reach different sections of the website, it is the central way of exploring and point of reference if the user gets lost.
* **Screen reader** and **keyboard users** should be aware which link is currently in focus and about the currently selected item.
* **Mouse** and **touch screen users**, as well as **users with shaky hands** need large targets to tap on.
