Forms are usually the main interaction component in websites. They’re used to send information to the server or for input and output in client-side JavaScript applications. A few simple rules help improving the accessiblity of forms:

- **[Descriptive labels](labels.html)** help users to know which data to put into each form field and if the field is required or not.

- **[Clear instructions](instructions.html):** To ensure that the user is aware of indicators or formats they need to use to complete the form.

- **[Understandable structure](structure.html):** Especially where the form is presented to the user over several pages, or there are multiple form controls covered by one single question.

- **[Error prevention](error-prevention.html) or help with [error correction](error-messages.html):** To assure successful submission.

## Why is this important?

Forms can be complex and difficult to use. Accessible forms are easier to use for everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **People using speech input assistive technology** can move the cursor into the fields they need to fill out using voice commands.

- **People with shaky hands** use the label as a larger clickable area for selecting small controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes.

- **People using screen readers** can identify the purpose of a form field if a label is properly assigned, including information on the format expected or if the field is required.

People with disabilities navigate and find content in different ways, read more on [“How people with disabilities use the web”](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/browsing#navigation).
