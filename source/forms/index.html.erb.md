Forms are usually the main interaction component in websites and web applications. They’re used to send information to the server or for input and output in client-side JavaScript applications.

- **[Labels](labels.html)** that are descriptive and properly associated to a form field help users to know which data to put into each form field.

- **[Instructions](instructions.html)** clarify what input is expected from the user and how to find out if a field is required or has to be entered in a specific format.

- **[Table Structure](structure.html)** helps to make the form easier to understand by grouping fields that belong to each other and splitting long forms up into multiple pages.

- **[Forms in Disguise](in-disguise.html)** are forms that don’t look like “classic” forms at the first sight. Instead they can be fairly complex interaction components.

- **[Error Prevention](error-prevention.html)** makes sure that the user did follow the instructions prior to submitting the form.

- **[Error Messages](error-prevention.html)** help users to correct errors after the form was sent.

## Why is this important?

Forms can be visually and cognitively complex and difficult to use. Accessible forms are easier to use for everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **People using speech input assistive technology** can move the cursor into the fields they need to fill out using voice commands.

- **People with shaky hands** use the label as a larger clickable area for selecting small controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes.

- **People using screen readers** can identify the purpose of a form field if a label is properly assigned, including information on the format expected or if the field is required.
