* **Keep it simple:** Complex forms are more often abandoned by users than simple forms, regardless how accessible they are.

* **Take data gracefully:** Try to interpret data as liberally as possible. Don’t throw error messages at users because they don’t obey the number of parentheses you expect.

* **Be careful with required formats:** Postal codes are not numbers in every country, so using and `input` of the type `number` could easily become a problem.

* **Forms are not art:** Be creative with forms but don’t alter them to drastically from the standard operating system look that users are used to.
