* **Keep it simple:** Complex forms are more often abandoned by users than simple forms, regardless how accessible they are. Only ask users to enter that is requierd to complete the transation or process; if extraneous data is requested, users often abandon the form.

* **Take data gracefully:** Try to interpret data as liberally as possible. Don’t throw error messages at users because they don’t obey the number of parentheses you expect. For example accept spaces, dashes, etc in phone numbers - these can be reoved afterwards if required.

* **Be careful with required formats:** Postal codes are not numbers in every country, so using and `input` of the type `number` could easily become a problem.

* **Forms are not art:** Be creative with forms but don’t alter them to drastically from the standard operating system look that users are used to.

* **Allow users to disable or extend time limits:** If possible, forms should not be subject to a time limit to allow users to complete the form in their own pace. If a time limit needs to be in place (for example, for security reasons), the user should have the possibility to turn it off, adjust it, or extend it. This does not apply if the time limit is due to a live event (like an auction or a game) or if the time to complete the form is essential for a valid submission.
