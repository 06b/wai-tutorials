Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. These tutorials are designed to help people create websites with improved code to reach the widest possible audience. The tutorials follow the [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) and provide website creators with practical guidance and examples that meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) standard.

The tutorials provide valuable resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web components that are easy to implement for a more inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of ways to integrate accessibility thinking into project planning.

The tutorials cover various accessibility topics that are task-based rather than technology-based. For example, the tutorials will show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, such as HTML4 and HTML5, as well as CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The underlying principles apply to other formats as well.

Additional tutorials are planned in will be added here once they are ready for public consumption.

Web authoring tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, and other tools, can help you create content that meet WCAG 2.0 when these tools follow the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag). More background and guidance is provided in [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](http://w3.org/wai/impl/software).
