These tutorials tutorials show you how to create web content that is accessible to people with disabilities and improves the user experience for all audiences.

-   **[Images](images/index.html):** Graphics and images are an important part of website design. In this tutorial, you can learn how to make images accessible, including decorative, linked, and grouped images.

-   **[Tables](tables/index.html):** Tables are essential for displaying data and the relationship between data points. Find out how you can add structural information to tables so that assistive technology can identify those relationships.

Additional tutorials are planned and will be added here once they are completed and reviewed.

The tutorials provide valuable resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web page components with built-in accessible and inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain an understanding of ways to integrate accessibility into their project planning.

For example, they will show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, and other tools, can help you create content that is accessible and inclusive as shown in these tutorials. More background and guidance is provided in [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](http://w3.org/wai/impl/software).
