These tutorials tutorials show you how to create web content that is accessible to people with disabilities and improves the user experience for all audiences.

-   **[Images](images/index.html):** Graphics and images are an important part of almost every web page. In this tutorial, you can learn where to use which kind of alternative text and how handle image groups and complex images.

-   **[Tables](tables/index.html):** Tables are a great way to show the relationship between certain data points. Find out how you can add structural information to tables to help assistive technology to resolve those relationships.

Additional tutorials are planned and will be added here once they are ready for public consumption.

The tutorials provide valuable resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web components that are easy to implement for a more inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of ways to integrate accessibility thinking into project planning.

For example, the tutorials will show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The underlying principles apply to other formats as well.

The tutorials follow the [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) and provide website creators with practical guidance and examples that meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) standard.

Web authoring tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, and other tools, can help you create content that meet WCAG 2.0 when these tools follow the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag). More background and guidance is provided in [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](http://w3.org/wai/impl/software).
