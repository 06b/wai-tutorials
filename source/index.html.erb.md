Building accessible websites feels like a challenge for many web teams, regardless of experience. These tutorials will help to apply [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) in the every day workflow of website creators by providing practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). They are useful to a variety of people, including:

* **Web developers** can find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common development challenges.
* **Web designers** can learn how to design web components that are easy to implement in an accessible way.
* **Web trainers** can find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** can learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** can gain understanding of accessibility approaches to help with project planning.

The tutorials introduce accessibility topics, including advanced aspects. They are a good starting point for learning and addressing WCAG. To ensure that you meet the WCAG requirements, you will still have to use WCAG resources directly.

Most of the examples are HTML-based and the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.
