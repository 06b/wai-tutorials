These tutorials show you how to develop web content that is accessible to people with disabilities and that provides a better user experience for everyone.

The tutorials provide resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web page components with built-in accessible and inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain an understanding of ways to integrate accessibility into their project planning.

For example, they show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools (Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, etc.) can often help you create content that is accessible as shown in these tutorials.

For *normative* information, see the [WCAG2.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Additional guidance can also be found in the (non-normative) techniques, see the [How to Meet WCAG 2.0 document](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

## Tutorial Topics

-   **[Page Structure](page-structure/index.html):** Discover possibilities to mark up websites to make them more accessible.

-   **[Menus](menus/index.html):** Get guidance on the development of menus on websites and in web applications.

-   **[Images](images/index.html):** Learn how to use images in an accessible way, including decorative, linked, and grouped images.

-   **[Tables](tables/index.html):** Find out how you can add structural information to tables so that assistive technology can identify the relationship between table headers and data.

-   **[Forms](forms/index.html):** Learn how labels and instructions inform users about the purpose of a form field and how it should be completed and how form validation can prevent users from submitting wrong data.

-   **[Carousels](carousels/index.html):** Study how an accessible, animated carousel is built.

Additional tutorials are planned and will be added here once they are completed and reviewed.
