These tutorials show you how to create web content that is accessible to people with disabilities and improve the user experience for all audiences.

They provide valuable resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web page components with built-in accessible and inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain an understanding of ways to integrate accessibility into their project planning.

For example, they will show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools, including Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, and other tools, can help you create content that is accessible and inclusive as shown in these tutorials. More background and guidance is provided in [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](http://w3.org/wai/impl/software).

## All Tutorials

-   **[Images](images/index.html):** Learn how to use images in an accessible way, including decorative, linked, and grouped images.

-   **[Tables](tables/index.html):** Find out how you can add structural information to tables so that assistive technology can identify the relationship between table headers and data.

Additional tutorials are planned and will be added here once they are completed and reviewed.
