Welcome to the web accessibility tutorials. These tutorials are designed to help people create websites with improved code to reach the widest possible audience. The tutorials follow the [Accessibility Principles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles) and provide support website creators with practical guidance and examples that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0) in different situations. 

The tutorials provide valuable resources for a variety of roles, including:

* **Web developers** will find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common coding challenges.
* **Web designers** will learn how to create web components that are easy to implement for a more inclusive design practice.
* **Web trainers** will find compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** will learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** will gain understanding of ways to integrate accessibility thinking into project planning.

The tutorials cover various accessibility topics that are task-based rather than technology-based. For example, the tutorials will show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, such as HTML and CSS, as well as WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. Additional tutorials are planned in will be added here once they are ready for public consumption.

Most examples are HTML-based, though the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools like Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, and other tools can help to create content that meet WCAG 2.0 when these tools follow the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag). More background and guidance is provided in [Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility](http://w3.org/wai/impl/software).
